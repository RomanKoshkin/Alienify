# Alienify/Zombify Yourself!

This code builds on StyleGAN2-ADA and Justin Pinkney's idea of blending the orininal StyleGAN2 and and the same network but fine-tuned on another dataset (e.g. aliens and zombies). You can train the network on your own dataset.

## Quick start
For quick start, run the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o6gsTHuA3G-FHohRN0lFquZX76eYRn50#scrollTo=mzog4xryYODB) hassle-free. If you have serious GPU compute, use it. Clone this notebook, make sure you have the right version dependencies, download the data (see the top of the Colab notebook).
